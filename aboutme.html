	<h1>Description About Myself</h1>
	<p>My name is Steven Arias I am currently 25 years old. I am currently enrolled at<br>
	BMCC also known as Borough of Manhattan Community College as a Animation and Motion Graphic major.<br>
	I was born and raised in brooklyn New York for all my life and I am half Dominican and half Ecuadorian.<br>
	I will be talking about things I like to do some of my favorite shows that I am currently watching. I will also<br>
	explain some of my goals that I want to achieve in the future.
	</p>
	<p>Some of my favorite shows that I am currently watching are Kaiju No.8, My Hero Academia, Shangri-La Frontier,<br>
	Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer. I have and am currently reading the mangas for Demon Slayer, My Hero Academia, and Kaiju No.8<br>
	As a kid I used to watch cartoons everyday both in the mornings before school and after school. I believe that as a child <br>
	watching all those shows made me enjoy animation more as I grew up. As a kid and still to this day I love Pokemon whether that be<br>
	still watching the classic shows from back in the day, playing the games that come out, to even collecting the cards that they make.<br>
	Which I might or might not have a problem with buying to many cards, but everone as an addiction to something my addiction is collecting<br>
	Pokemon cards and Funko pop. I would say the main problem with collecting is space because I currently have almost 2 full shelves of funko pop.
	</p>
	<p>I would say my long term goals are to buy my first house, make a small animated series which is a work in progress as I continue to learn<br>
	more about animating. Something that most do not know about me is that I like to bake. I am still trying to learn how to make homemade<br>
	pizza which I have done but I would love to get better at making the dough and sauce. I also enjoy watching wrestling, playing video games<br>
	most nintendo games and some warzone for the people who know. I would say I'm a very creative person which is a good and bad thing sometimes<br>
	as I tend to come up with and idea when change my mind and start over and never get my ideas done.

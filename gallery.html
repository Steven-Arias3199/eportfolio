Barnacles are crustaceans that attach to the shells and skin of sea turtles, and can be beneficial or harmful to the turtle's health
Benefits:
Barnacles can filter water, which helps keep the ocean clean and benefits other marine life. They can also protect turtles from predators and harmful organisms.

Harms
Barnacles can become a problem if there are too many of them, or if they burrow into the turtle's skin
- A large number of barnacles can weigh down a turtle, making it harder to swim.
- Barnacles can grow over a turtle's eyes, making it difficult to see.
- Barnacles that burrow into the skin can create an opening for infection.
- Barnacles can embed in the shell and create cracks that allow bacteria and other organisms to get in.
